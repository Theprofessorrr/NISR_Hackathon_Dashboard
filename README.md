# NISR_Hackathon_Dashboard
The dashboard I built uses data from the NISR Labour Force survey. I used Streamlit framework in python to do that because I had already some knowledge in python and with all
the availale ressources online for streamlit I thought it would an advantadge for me.
The dashboard I built gives insights on unemployment and employment constituing the Labour Force and its behavior depending on location,gender, area of residence and age.
